## OpenSDP Fake County Teacher Dataset (Stata)

### Description

The Fake County synthetic panel dataset contains approximately 40,000 records
comprising four years of data with roughly 10,000 teachers per year. The dataset
includes information about teacher demographics, teaching assignments, salary,
credentials, experience, evaluation scores, and hiring and retention status. It
also includes information about school types and average student characteristics
for each school. There are no real teachers in the dataset, but it is based on
real data. Fake County was developed as an offshoot of the Strategic Data
Project's work on human capital diagnostics for school districts and state
education departments, and can be used for teaching or collaboration. The data
was synthesized using the R [synthpop](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/synthpop/index.html)
package.
